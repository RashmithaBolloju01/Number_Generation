# Number Generator

Number Generator is a Python-based interactive project that generates random or custom-defined number sequences based on user input. Implemented in Jupyter Notebook, it serves as a foundational utility for random number logic, testing routines, simulations, or simple mathematical operations.

# Project Overview

The project allows users to generate single or multiple numbers with flexible control — such as range, count, and repeatability. Designed for educational purposes, it demonstrates the use of randomization, input handling, and logic flow within a notebook interface.

# Features

Generate random integers within a specified range
Support for generating multiple numbers at once
Option to avoid duplicates in generated output
Simple user interaction through code cell inputs
Easily extendable for advanced use cases like prime generation, even/odd filters, or seeded outputs

# Technologies Used

Category	Tools and Libraries
Language	Python
Randomization	random, numpy
Notebook	Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
I/O Handling	input(), print()

# How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/RashmithaBolloju01/Number_Generation.git
cd Number-Generator
Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook Number_generation.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook cells to generate numbers based on your chosen parameters.
Make sure Python and Jupyter Notebook are properly installed before running.

# Sample Use Case

A developer, student, or teacher wants to generate a quick set of random numbers between 1 and 100 for testing, quizzes, or simulation. Instead of using external tools, this notebook provides a self-contained solution that can be adapted easily.

# Future Enhancements

Add support for generating floating-point numbers
Integrate filters (e.g., only even/odd, divisible by N)
Include export options to save outputs as .txt or .csv
Build a Streamlit interface for non-programmers
